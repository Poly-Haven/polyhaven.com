  "all-future-locked-p2": "The Vaults are in addition to our regular free content, not a replacement.",
  "all-future-locked-p3": "Similarly, all of our community projects and donated assets will always be immediately free to the public. Only large collections that require significant investment to create ourselves may be locked in a Vault.",

  "is-crowdfunding": "Is this like a crowdfunding project or Patreon goal?",
  "is-crowdfunding-p1": "In a way, yes. In the past, we tried both Patreon goals and crowdfunding campaigns, with the promise that once we reached the funding goal we would start working on the project.",
  "is-crowdfunding-p2": "This is similar, except we work on the project up front before the funding goal is reached, trusting that our community will support us and cover the funds later over time.",
  "is-crowdfunding-p3": "While we have to pay for the development costs up front, this way we can work on more projects sooner, and reward our supporters with early access before the funding goal is met.

  "what-happens-release": "What happens when a Vault is released?",

  "what-happens-release-p3": "We will anounce the release on Patreon, as well as social media. The Vault page will be removed, and the assets will become available for free download.",
  "what-happens-release-p4": "Some Vaults may turn into a <collectionLink>collection</collectionLink>, while others simply merge into the main library.",
  "what-if-no-goal": "What if we don't reach the funding goals?",
