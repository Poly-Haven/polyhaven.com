  "why": {
    "h1": "Why are we doing this?",
    "p1": "Because we can!",
    "p2": "And because we believe we can help the greater 3D community grow by providing our assets for free rather than selling them.",

    "p2": "Sharing our assets is our priority, but we also want to share our knowledge, so that others might learn how to create assets like ours and perhaps share them as well.",
    "li1": "We write regular Dev Logs on <lnk>our blog</lnk> to share what we've been working on recently.",
    "li2": "Our <lnk>posts on Patreon</lnk> are also a good place to find smaller updates and polls when we need help making decisions.",
    "li3": "<lnk>Discord</lnk> is where we hang out every day, feel free to say hi!",
    "li4": "Our social media is primarily automated for posting our latest assets, but we're occasionally active there too (links in the <lnk>footer</lnk>).",
    "li5": "Our <lnk>finance reports</lnk> detail exactly how we spend or save our funds."

  "help": {
    "h1": "How you can help",
    "s1": "Support us on Patreon",
    "s1p1": "If you have some disposable income and you want to help us publish more free HDRIs, textures and 3D models, you can support us with a small monthly donation on <lnk>Patreon</lnk> :)",
    "s1p2": "In return, we can give you some small token of thanks, like access to a cloud folder that you can sync to your hard drive so you always have our latest assets at your fingertips, or immortalize your name on our site.",
    "s1p3": "We use your donations directly to cover our expenses and fund new assets, as verified by our <lnk>finance reports</lnk>.",

    "s2p2": "We have a strict standard of quality to maintain, and everything we publish has to be <lnk1>CC0</lnk1>, but if your asset is accepted the whole 3D community will benefit from it. <lnk2>Read more and submit your asset here</lnk2>.",
    "s3": "Spread the word",
    "s3p1": "It's OK if you can't afford to, or don't want to donate to us :) You can still help us grow by making sure your friends and co-workers know about us, the more people we can help the better!",
    "s3p2": "It's not required at all, but if you use our assets in your work you can mention where you got them from and that'll help show more people that we exist"
