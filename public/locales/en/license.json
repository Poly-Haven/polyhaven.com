  "p1": "All assets (<lnk1>HDRIs</lnk1>, <lnk2>textures</lnk2> and <lnk3>3D models</lnk3>) on this site are the original work of Poly Haven staff, or artists who willingly and directly donate/sell their work to Poly Haven.",
  "p2": "Our assets are all licensed as <lnk1>CC0</lnk1>, which is effectively <lnk2>Public Domain</lnk2> even in jurisdictions that do not support the Public Domain.",
  "p3": "Here's an excerpt from the <lnk>CC0 FAQ page</lnk> to clarify:",
  "p4": "In other words:",
  "p5l1": "<b>You can use our assets for any purpose</b>, including commercial work.",
  "p5l2": "<b>You do not need to give credit</b> or attribution when using them (although it is appreciated).",

  "p10": "But what the 3D industry as a whole gains from our work being so freely available is immeasurable",
  "p11": "3D art is also only the tip of the iceberg, we've heard from numerous data scientists, software developers, automotive engineers and AI researchers all using our assets in their work, which simply wouldn't be possible with more restrictive (even open source) licenses.",
  "p12": "We don't have anything against Copyright in general, we simply believe we can do more good in the world by providing as much freedom as possible.",
  "p13": "If you benefit from our work financially, e.g. by including our assets in a product you sell, or simply make frequent use of them in your own work, please consider <lnk>supporting us on Patreon</lnk> with a small monthly donation in order to help us continue to produce more assets and maintain this platform."
